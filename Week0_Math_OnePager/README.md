* **Simple Moving Equations:** 

 location = location + velocity
 velocity = velocity + acceleration

 Change direction by multiplying velocity by -1.

---
* **Polar Coordinates:**  
 
 x = r * cos(theta);
 y = r * sin(theta);

---
* **Simple Harmonic Motion/Oscillations:** 

x = amplitude * cos(TWO_PI * frameCount / period);

---
* **Individual Pixel:** 

pixel = (x + (y * width))* 4
