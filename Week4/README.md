# Week 4: Conditionals, Processes, and Algorithms

* Variables:
	* Incrementation operators: x = x + 1; is the same as x+=1; and the same as x++;
	* Conditional operators: AND &&, OR ||, EQUALS ==, NOT !
	* IF, Else, Else if
	* map() function
	* noise() function
	* frameCount(), frameRate, millis()
	* second(), minute(), hour()

## Bonus Material:

* Basic Kinematics
	* location = location + velocity
	* velocity = velocity + acceleration
* Polar Coordinates:
	* x = rcos(θ)
	* y=rsin(θ)
* Simple Harmonic Motion
	* x = A COS(2* PI * time/period)
* Perlin Noise: noise()



## Design Across Scales Precedents:
